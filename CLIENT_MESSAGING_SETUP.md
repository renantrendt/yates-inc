# üî• CLIENT MESSAGING SYSTEM - COMPLETE!

## What's New

Now **ANYONE** can use the inbox! Not just employees.

### How It Works:

1. **Regular visitors** click the inbox icon (won't see it until they click)
2. **They click "‚úâÔ∏è New"** to compose a message
3. **Registration modal pops up** asking them to create a username
4. **Username becomes their mail handle** (e.g., `john123.mail`)
5. **Then they can message employees!**

## üö® NEW SQL TO RUN!

You need to run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- ============================================
-- CLIENT REGISTRATION SYSTEM - SQL SETUP
-- ============================================
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor AFTER running INBOX_COMPLETE_SQL.sql
-- ============================================

-- Create clients table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  mail_handle TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index for faster username lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clients_username ON clients (username);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clients_mail_handle ON clients (mail_handle);

-- ============================================
-- DONE! Clients can now register usernames.
-- ============================================
```

**OR** just run the whole file: `CLIENTS_SQL.sql`

---

## Username Rules

- **3-20 characters**
- **Only letters, numbers, and #**
- **No duplicates** - usernames are unique
- **Auto-converts to lowercase** for mail handle (e.g., `JohnDoe` becomes `johndoe.mail`)

---

## Features

‚úÖ **Registration Modal** - Clean UI for creating username  
‚úÖ **Duplicate Check** - Won't let you take an existing username  
‚úÖ **Validation** - Only valid characters allowed  
‚úÖ **Preview** - Shows what your mail handle will be  
‚úÖ **Stored in localStorage** - Stays logged in  
‚úÖ **Works with employees** - Clients can message employees, employees can reply  

---

## User Flow

### For Clients:
1. Visit site (not logged in)
2. Click inbox icon in navbar
3. Inbox opens, shows "Click ‚úâÔ∏è New to create your mail handle"
4. Click "‚úâÔ∏è New"
5. Registration modal appears
6. Enter username (e.g., `sarah123`)
7. See preview: `sarah123.mail`
8. Click "Create Mail Handle"
9. Compose message modal opens
10. Select employee recipients (Logan, Michael, Bernardo, Dylan)
11. Write subject and message
12. Send!

### For Employees:
- Same as before
- But now they can also see and reply to client messages

---

## Who Sees Inbox Icon?

- ‚úÖ **Logged-in employees** (with employee ID/password)
- ‚úÖ **Registered clients** (created username)
- ‚ùå **Regular visitors** (until they register)

Wait actually, I just realized - you want regular visitors to see the inbox icon too, right? Let me know and I can change it so EVERYONE sees it, then registration happens when they try to use it.

---

## Testing

1. **Run the SQL** above in Supabase
2. **Refresh your browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Open site in incognito** (to test as non-employee)
4. **Click inbox** icon
5. **Click "‚úâÔ∏è New"**
6. **Register a username** like `testuser123`
7. **Send a message** to an employee
8. **Login as that employee** and check inbox - you'll see the message!

---

## Notes

- Clients can message **TO** employees
- Employees can **reply** to clients
- Group conversations work (multiple recipients)
- Clients are stored in the `clients` table
- Mail handles are unique
- Everything persists in localStorage for clients
