#### Cul ideas
So after we've done the minigae, add a credit system insteado of an credit card thing, then in the minegame you can choose to go to the YB(yates bank), and in it you'll be able to create a Yates card, and then you get your number and stuff, and you
put those numebrs in the paywall so you can pay with it.

















### mID IMPORTANCE
- Check if the card tingis are omly #'s and stuff

- CPS when click buy, it goes to a /cps page, and the thing appears a txt box that you can ask for the CPS, and you can click send 
once clicked a task is created on MMMM's dashboard
