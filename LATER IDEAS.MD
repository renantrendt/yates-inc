- Lore:
    the screen goes black and a text goes: 
                                - The United Yates of America, was created while
                            yates was bored and used all of his power to create
                        the UYA. Then around the same decade Walters, another
                    semi-god, and he also made his own island, Walters land. 
                Another semi-god, is Kato, Kato is the assitant of Walters and his
            right arm.
(While this text goes on, show, img from above of each island. Also when their 
names are spoken, an img of them appear on the screen.)

                                - Yates powers: Yates, has super strengh and is
                            buff.  Transformation: Omega Yates, gets a 67% upgrade in everything, also his height goes to 8''6
                            to 10'11ft
                        - Mr.Walters powers: He has supper speed he is very
                    good at dodgin. Transformation: Iron Walters he gets 80% extra speed, and 45% extra dodgin skills, also he goes from 7''8 to 11ft 
                - Kato powers: Coach Kato, has the ability of ultra

(Imgs of them showing off their skills in their own areas of their islands.)

### The first War.

- Mr.Yates and Walters, found each other while going to the US, to a World wide meeting. While they we're leaving they start having an argument on which of the islands, UYA or Warlters land, was better.
Iimg of their meeting, img of them going to their islands, conflict starting in the Clash Royale Sea.

    - The fight:
            Omega yates fires a fireball with the strenght of 2 Nukes, on Iron walters, then Iron Walters does a side flip 
        dodgin and then while he's dodgin he throws a laser blast, then Yates uses his Abs shield to deflect the atack. And 
    then they both lock in, and use their Domain expansion.
                                        (Yates domain expansion does ???) 
   Then their fists clash and Walters goes flying, yates goes full speed to punch walters but then Kato uses his Domain expansion paralising Yates, and and leaving with Walters. 
        That was their first clash.

- The Second fight.
    Yates was hunting down Walters and once he caught Walter's defense down, he striket with a critical hit, using 1000% of his
    strenght, breaking Walters right arm. Then Walters activated his Iron Swit, and striked Yates, with a Ultra sonic combo, hitting him, hundreds of times in a milisecond, injuring Yates critically, then Yates uses his domain expansion, 究極の筋肉
    making him 2x stronger, and more resistent, but just before he used his 究極の筋肉 (kyukyoku no kin'niko), Walters used his
    超音波領域 (Choonpa ryoiki), and out powred Yates, due to his injury, and he's able to land lots of crital hits on yates, 
    so much that he was on his knees, almost falling. But then he used his secret unrevealed tecnique 超力×2 where he get ultra
    powerful and is able to land a full on power hit on Walters abs, making him go flying, then Yates enraged goes on and does
    a 12 combo of full on power punches, knocking down Walters layed on his back unconsious. Yates now in his enraged form
    starts beating the hell out of uncocious Walters. But then out of no where, Kato in his UltATO transformation come from under the ground with a upper cut directly on Yates jaw, then summoning his army of shadows to swarm Yates, then Kato uses his 史上最高だ pausing the time, and Yates, then he puts him to sleep and, teleport him and Walters to hospitals in their respective islands.
- ALl of this is going with text and background things showing the action, you'll need to lock in and make it somehow, probably pixels or something, or like install some kind of library or idk. Also the text should appear somewherre in the screen, and the images should appear to their respective texts, just so its acurate.
