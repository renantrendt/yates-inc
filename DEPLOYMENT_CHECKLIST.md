## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Supabase connection error
- Check that `.env.local` exists and has correct values
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check that tables were created successfully

### Issue: Images not loading
- Verify all images are in `/public` folder
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Cart not persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Try in incognito/private mode to rule out extensions

### Issue: Employee login not working
- Verify employees table in Supabase has correct data
- Check passwords match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Look at browser console for error messages

## Notes

- The app uses client-side state management (no server-side sessions)
- Cart data is stored in localStorage
- Employee sessions persist across refreshes
- All employee passwords are stored in plain text (this is just a demo/satirical site)
- No real payment processing - it's all UI/UX simulation
